# Spira

## Prerequisites

Max MSP 8 must be installed

## Setup

Open spira.maxpat. The project will automatically start running the piece after 3 seconds. This will not work since
the node project has not been set up and there is no video to play. Exit fullscreen and click the install show program button.
This will set up the node program.
You will also need to add the video file to the root folder. Is should be called [INSERT NAME].
Once these two steps have been completed you can click start show to run the program. After this initial setup it is enough
to open spira.maxpat to run the show.

To open the show automatically on startup I recommend using automator on mac to find the file and open it. It might be advisable
to put in a 3 second pause before starting the program. Save the automator script as an application and add it to your log in items.
